Hi!
Welcome to my github!

I'm a full stack software engineer with ~4 years of professional experience in developing web and mobile applications with a focus on the back-end.
I really enjoy learning new languages and diving deep into the realm of software. Often times I find myself digging deep into abstract code and 
taking it apart to figure out how it really works. Being challenged empowers me to keep doing what I love and I'm always on the move to learn 
new technologies and ways of doing things.
